# KM-UM-IOCTL-Communication-Framework
## A minimal and efficient framework for communication between Kernel Mode (KM) and User Mode (UM) components via IOCTL calls.

This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) developed by me to show how you can set up a simple and efficient communication channel between a user-mode app and a kernel-mode driver using IOCTL requests. It provides a clean and extensible foundation for custom driver interactions, focusing on simplicity, performance, and stability.
